# Welcome to Charty

Charty is a modern charting library for Kotlin Multiplatform, designed to help you easily create beautiful and interactive charts for your applications.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To get started with Charty, you need to add it as a dependency to your project.

_(Detailed installation instructions will be added here based on the project's build system, e.g., Gradle.)_

### Basic Usage

Once Charty is installed, you can start creating charts with just a few lines of code.

```kotlin
// Example of creating a simple bar chart (illustrative)
val data = listOf( /* your data here */ )
val barChart = Charty.BarChart(data)

// Display the chart in your UI (platform-specific)
```

_(More detailed usage examples will be provided in the specific chart documentation.)_

## Library Purpose

The main goal of Charty is to provide a flexible and easy-to-use API for developers to integrate various types of charts into their Kotlin Multiplatform projects, covering Android, iOS, Desktop, and Web applications. We aim for high performance, extensive customization options, and a consistent look and feel across platforms.
